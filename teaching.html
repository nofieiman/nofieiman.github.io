  <h1>Teaching Philosophy</h1>

  <p>Even though my passion is leaned towards research and writing, I strongly believe that it is remarkably special to be able to inspire inquiring minds and help students become something much more than they thought they were capable of.</p>

  <p>My philosophy of teaching is based on a belief that learning needs to be student centered and that students need to be equal partners in the learning process. My role involves using my expertise and experience to put the necessary resources in the hands of the students to be sure that students are well equipped to find and evaluate whatever they need to answer their questions and solve their problems.</p>

  <p>In total, I have been teaching for about 10 years now. In my classes, I draw on my knowledge and experience, my research and published works, and most of all on reflexive practice—continuously evaluating the effectiveness of my approaches to student learning. For instance, it is uncommon for me to teach using the same material as the previous semester or year, nor do I use the default PowerPoint slides provided by book publishers.</p>

  <h1>PhD Supervision</h1>
  
  <p>In an ideal academic setting, I would gladly welcome applications from potential PhD students (and I do receive such emails) and involve them in interesting projects from the start. Unfortunately, that is not how the system works here. You must first apply formally to FEB UGM and complete one or two semesters of coursework. After that, the school will assign each candidate to an appropriate supervisor for their PhD thesis.</p>
