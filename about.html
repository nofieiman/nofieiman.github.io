  <h1>About</h1>
  <p>I am an associate professor at the Department of Management, Faculty of Economics and Business, Universitas Gadjah Mada (FEB UGM). I earned my PhD in Management from the London School of Economics and Political Science (LSE) and an MSc in the Management of Science, Technology, and Innovation from the University of Manchester.</p>
  <p>Prior to joining FEB UGM and pursuing my PhD, I was a lecturer at Prasetiya Mulya Business School. My work focuses on technological innovation, organization, and strategy. Since I completed my undergraduate degree in accounting, however, I also have a keen interest in finance—purely for personal curiosity. Old habits die hard.</p>
  <p>I have been involved in research and consulting for government and industry, and I write regularly for Indonesian media. I am often invited by organizations and companies to speak on topics related to technology, innovation, and strategy. Beyond teaching and research, I am a mid-handicap golfer and a weekend runner.</p>
