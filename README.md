# Minimal Personal Site (GitHub Pages)

A clean, modern, white-based starter for a personal website.

## Publish steps
1. Create a **public** repo named `YOUR-USERNAME.github.io`.
2. Upload all files from this folder (or push with Git).
3. In **Settings → Pages**, set **Deploy from a branch → main → /**.
4. Visit `https://YOUR-USERNAME.github.io`.

## Customize
- Edit text in `index.html`, `about.html`, `research.html`, and `writing.html`.
- Change colors and spacing in `assets/style.css`.
- Add pages: copy an HTML file and link it in the header `<nav>`.
